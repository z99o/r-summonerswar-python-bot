# r-summonerswar-python-bot

Ok this might look a little weird to anyone coming here from LinkedIn or some other site. For context, this is a little project I did in my
sophmore year of high school. What this python script does, is run a bot on a subreddit for a mobile game I used to play (although it no longer is
running on the site because nobody really used it). Basically it would find a comment with a certain name from the game formatted like this
[[ name ]] and then reply to that comment with information on the name inside the brackets. This bot was based on a bot in the hearthstone
subreddit, which used the same bracket format. Looking back at the code, I made from major mistakes and beginner errors in it, such as having
the whole program in a loop with no base case or break condition. Overally I'm proud of this project and hope people and employers can see where
I started programming.
